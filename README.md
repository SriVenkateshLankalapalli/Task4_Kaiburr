# Task4_Kaiburr
This project implements a CI/CD pipeline for the Task Management Application (backend from Task 1 and frontend from Task 3) using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates code validation, builds the application, creates a Docker image, and optionally deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster or a cloud service.
CI/CD Pipeline for Task Management Application
This project implements a CI/CD pipeline for the Task Management Application (backend from Task 1 and frontend from Task 3) using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates code validation, builds the application, creates a Docker image, and optionally deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster or a cloud service.

Features
✅ Automated Testing - Runs unit tests on every commit
✅ Code Build - Compiles and checks for errors
✅ Docker Build & Push - Builds a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub/GitHub Container Registry
✅ Deployment - Deploys the application to Kubernetes (Optional)

CI/CD Pipeline Steps
Trigger: Runs on push/pull request to the main branch

Setup: Installs dependencies and sets up the environment

Build: Compiles the code (both backend & frontend)

Test: Runs unit tests

Docker Build & Push: Builds Docker images and pushes them to a container registry

Deployment: Deploys to Kubernetes (if configured)

Tech Stack
GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation)

Docker (Containerization)

Kubernetes (Deployment)

Helm (Optional, for managing Kubernetes deployments)

YAML (Pipeline configuration)

GitHub Actions Workflow
Example .github/workflows/cicd.yml configuration:

      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t your-docker-repo/task-app:latest .

      - name: Push to Docker Hub
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
          docker push your-docker-repo/task-app:latest

  deploy:
    needs: docker-build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        run: kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
