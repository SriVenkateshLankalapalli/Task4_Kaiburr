# Task4_Kaiburr
This project implements a CI/CD pipeline for the Task Management Application (backend from Task 1 and frontend from Task 3) using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates code validation, builds the application, creates a Docker image, and optionally deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster or a cloud service.
